title: "Launch the CLI"
---

In version 0.4.0 we introduced an initial command-line interface, with a basic set of features from Gradience UI.

# How to launch CLI

There are two different ways to launch CLI, one is for Flatpak version of Gradience, and another is for Gradience installed from other sources.

## Flatpak approach

If using Gradience as a Flatpak package, launch CLI with:

```bash
flatpak run --command=gradience-cli com.github.GradienceTeam.Gradience --help
```

## Alternative approach

Launch CLI with a dedicated command: `gradience-cli`
