The recommended method is to use Flatpak but you can also choose to use a package for your distro (we officialy support AUR and RPM).

# Flatpak

To install Gradience, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
flatpak install com.github.GradienceTeam.Gradience
``` 

This is the preferred method to install Gradience, as it will always install the most recent stable release in a portable way whatever the distribution you use.

If you don't have [flatpak](https://flatpak.org) installed, this [Flatpak installation guide](https://flatpak.org/setup/) can guide
you through the process.
